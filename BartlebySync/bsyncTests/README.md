Those sample tests are now compilable.
But they are neither rigourous nor well structured! 

## Principles 

1. Each test should be non intrusive ( any creation should be delete if possible)
2. You should create on test Class per thema.
3. The test should remain configurable (Check TestConfiguration.swift)
